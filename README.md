# lcdi2c

This supercedes lcdi2c_original.

This is a backup for the local development repo for I2C LCD routines, used in conjunction with STM32CubeMX. 
The goal is multiple I2C buses with multiple LCD units on a bus.

You are free to use it, but do not blame me for the problems that are sure to arise.
